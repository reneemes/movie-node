      <p>
        This application is a Node.js and Express–powered movie discovery platform 
        that uses The Movie Database (TMDB) API to help users find films they’ll love. 
        By entering the title of a movie, users receive a list of similar movies based 
        on TMDB’s recommendation data, making it easy to discover new titles related 
        to their interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to personalized recommendations, the app also showcases top-rated movies, 
        allowing users to browse critically acclaimed films and explore popular choices. 
        Whether users are looking for something similar to a favorite movie or simply 
        want to see what’s highly rated, the application provides an intuitive and engaging experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project highlights the use of server-side JavaScript, RESTful API integration, 
        and dynamic content rendering with Express, offering both practical functionality 
        and a clean user experience.
