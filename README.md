        This application is a Node.js and Express–based web app that integrates with 
        The Movie Database (TMDB) API to help users discover new movies. 
        Users can enter the title of a movie they enjoy, and the app will return a 
        curated list of similar movies based on TMDB’s recommendation data.

        In addition to personalized recommendations, the application also displays a 
        selection of top-rated movies, allowing users to browse highly acclaimed titles 
        and explore popular films they may have missed. By combining user-driven search
         with trusted rating data, the app makes finding great movies quick, 
         intuitive, and enjoyable.

        The project demonstrates the use of RESTful APIs, server-side routing with Express, 
        and dynamic data rendering, making it a practical example of building a 
        modern web application with Node.js.
